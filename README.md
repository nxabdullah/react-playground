### Purpose
The purpose for building this simple application was to get a hang of how  [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) works. Additionally, I was able to play around with the [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) which is a component library built on top of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

My goal is that anyone reading through through this project will be able to get a high level overview of how Redux Toolkit works. 

Note: This is a really simple application and it does not really make sense to use Redux for an application of such small scale (check out You '[When should I use Redux?](https://redux.js.org/faq/general#when-should-i-use-redux)' from the Redux Docs if interested in learning more). You can easily use `useContext` and `useReducer` to achieve the same state management as I have here. However, this still demonstrates how react toolkit works pretty well (in my opinion).
